## Intro
Have you ever looked into a clear night sky and been amazed at the number of lights you can see? Even standing on earth, with its light pollution, 
one can still see many objects in space with the naked eye including some of our neighbor planets. To the untrained eye, however, it is hard to distinguish 
Jupiter or Mars from the stars. Astronomers also have this problem, but on a much larger scale.  

## Introduce Exoplanets
Before humans could put powerful telescopes in space, we had to work with relatively simple, ground-based telescopes. (Bad implication?) Up until 1995, 
the only planets we could see were the ones in our own solar system. Any models we made before 1995 about planetary formation were therefore only based
on our solar system. Luckily, as we foudn out later, our solar system has many properties in common with other planetary systems, so our models could be 
applied elsewhere. 

Located 50 light-years away, the first planet outside our solar system was discovered in 1995. It's called 51 Pegasi b, or simply 51 Peg. It is roughly
146 times earth's mass, has an orbital period of roughly 4 days, and has a nearly circular orbit. 51 Peg has size and mass comparable to Jupiter, yet 
is about 7 times closer to its sun than mercury is to our sun. Because of this, planets with these characteristics are described as Hot Jupiters. 

## Detection problem
When we look into the sky in the afternoon, we might the see moon if it is "apart" from the sun and is reflecting sunlight back to us. However, if the moon
is near the line of sight of the sun, we can't see the moon since the sun's own light totally swamps out anything reflected by the moon. When we look 
for exoplanets, which are many light years away, it is exceedingly rare to be able to directly observe them, partly due to this effect. Therefore we
must indirectly observe them. 

## Introduce Radial Velocity
The reason a planet is able to orbit a star is that the star exerts a gravitational attractive force on the planet, keeping it in a bound orbit.  
However, Newton's 3rd Law requires that the planet exerts the same force on the host star. Since the host star is commonly orders of magnitude greater
in mass than the planet, the star's motion will be barely affected by the planet. However, the heavier and closer the planet is, the stronger the effect.
In a simplified model, this will cause the center of mass of the host star to also orbit the common center of mass of the system. We can use the star's
motion to help predict the existance of an orbiting planet. 

In order to find a star moving in a circle like this, we use a technique called Doppler Spectroscopy, commonly known as the Radial Velocity method. 
This techniue combines spectroscopy and the Doppler effect, hence the name. Spectrospcopy, in general, decomposes light coming from a source into 
bands that can determine what sort of elements a star is composed of. This is a little bit similar to using a prism to split a beam of white light
into a rainbow. Each chemical element has a known spectroscopic "signature" that is fundamentally characteristic of the element. When we look at 
the spectrum of stars with exoplanets, we notice an interesting effect: The spectrum seems to shift to one side, then shift back toward the other
direction, and repeat like that. The chemical composition of the star is essentially constant on this timescale, so something else must be causing
this shift.

This is where the Doppler effect comes in. The Doppler effect is most tangible with sirens on an ambulance or police car. When the car is approaching 
you, the pitch increases, and when it is moing away from you, the pitch decreases. Electromagnetic radiation behaves in a very similar way, and we
describe this effect in terms of redshift and blueshift. When a light-emitting body moves toward an observer, the observed frequency is higher than
the proper emitted frequency, resulting in a shift "up" the EM spectrum, toward the blue side of visible light. The shift in frequency is related to 
the relative velocity of the emitter and the observer.

When we combine this knowledge with spectroscopic data, we can determine the star's velocity variance. Finally, using Kepler's 3rd Law, we can determine
the mass ratio of the planet to its host star, as well as the orbital period. As an analogy, imagine if we heard an ambulance siren that was roughly maintaining
its volume, but its pitch was going up and down periodically. We would then assume that the ambulance was continually going around a traffic circle. 
 
## RV Complications
This technique has been used to successfully find many exoplanets, but it has some drawbacks
(Elaborate) - sin i problem, orbit eccentricity makes it harder, only good for large planets close to star - skews distribution of discovered planets.



## Introduce Transit Method
In 1999, astronomers were able to confirm the existance of the exoplanet HD 209458b using a new detection technique, the transit method. This exoplanet
is 159 light-years from us, and is a Hot Jupiter (?). This characteristic makes it a candidate for radial velocity detection, and indeed it was originally
discovered this way. However, it is also detectable using the transit method technique.

Normally, the light intensity coming from a star is constant, at least on a month to month timescale. However, an orbiting exoplanet might periodically
block our line of sight to the star. This will result in some of the star's light being reflected away from us, which will decrease the overall apparent
luminosity of the star. If this happens regularly, with a similar dip in luminosity each time, then this is strong evidence that something is orbiting
the star. The ratio of the planet's and star's radii determine how much light is blocked, and duration of the blockage can help find the orbital radius.

A very similar effect occurs during solar eclipses, when the moon is very close to being in between earth and the sun, and blocks some sunlight from 
reaching earth. However, this effect is slightly different because of the relative distances. Although the sun is roughly 400 times greater in radius than
then moon, the moon can totally eclipse the sun and block essentially all of its light. This is possible because the moon is also 390 times closer to us
than the sun is, making it appear that much larger. 

When detecting exoplanets however, the distance to the star or exoplanet is orders of magnitude greater than the average orbital radius (light years versus
light minutes). Therefore this resizing effect (?) is ignorable and the blocked light as only a function of the ratio of surface areas.  

## Transit Complications
There are some complications, for example, if the planet doesn't cross the midline of the star and instead "grazes" the top of it. In addition, multiplanet
stars produce more complicated transit data and it is harder to resolve each planet individually. Furthermore, the transit method completely relies on a 
rather unlikely event of the planet blocking a bit of the star light. There could be other reasons that the star is blocked, for example, a non-orbiting 
planet from another system happens to come into the line of sight. For this reason, we need to confirm periodic dips in luminosity, and that takes time.
Therefore, this method is most effective at finding Hot Jupiters - planets which are large and block a larger percent of star light, and planets which are
closer to the star, have smaller orbit periods, and can produce periodic dips faster.
      
## Conclusion with focus on looking for life-sustaining planets
Radial velocity and transits are two complementary methods for finding exoplanets. There are also other methods that work better with planets that are not
Hot Jupiters. Astronomers use these techniques to find exoplanets and develop our understanding of our universe. In recent years, special attention has 
been given to researching planets that could support life. Of particular interest are terrestrial planets, planets which have similar size and mass to earth.
Furthermore, we would like to find planets which are not too close or too far from their host star, as this would make the planet too hot or too cold for life. 
Once we find a suitable planet, the next step would be to look for precursors to sustaining life, such as water and an atmosphere.
