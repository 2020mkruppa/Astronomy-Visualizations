Have you ever looked into a clear night sky and been amazed at the number of lights you can see? Even standing on earth, with its light pollution, 
one can still see many objects in space with the naked eye including some of our neighbor planets. To the untrained eye, it is hard to distinguish 
Jupiter or Mars from any star. Astronomers have this problem also, but on a much larger scale.  

Before humans could put powerful telescopes in space, we had to work with relatively simple, ground-based telescopes. Up until 1995, the only planets
we could see were the ones in our own solar system. Any models we made before 1995 about planetary formation were therefore only testable on our own
solar system. Luckily, our solar system has properties very common in other planetary systems, so our models could be used elsewhere. 

Located 50 light-years away, the first planet outside our solar system was discovered in 1995. It's called 51 Pegasi b, or simply 51 Peg. It is roughly
146 times earth's mass, has an orbital period of roughly 4 days, and has a nearly circular orbit. 51 Peg has size and mass comparable to Jupiter, yet 
is about 7 times closer to its sun than mercury is to our sun. Because of this, planets with these characteristics are described as Hot Jupiters. 

When we look into the sky in the afternoon, we might the see moon if it is "apart" from the sun and is reflecting light back to us. However, if the moon
is near the line of sight of the sun, we can't see the moon since the sun's own light totally swamps out anything reflected by the moon. When we look 
for exoplanets, which are many light years away, it is exceedingly rare to be able to directly observe them, partly due to this effect. Therefore we
must indirectly observe them. 

The reason a planet is able to orbit a star is that the star exerts a gravitational attractive force on the planet, keeping it in a bound orbit.  
However, Newton's 3rd Law requires that the planet exerts the same force on the host star. Since the host star is commonly orders of magnitude greater
in mass than the planet, the star's motion will be barely affected by the planet. However, the heavier and closer the planet is, the stronger the effect.
In a simplified model, this will cause the center of mass of the host star to also orbit the common center of mass of the system. We can use the star's
motion to help predict the existance of an orbiting planet. 

In order to find a star moving in a circle like this, we use a technique called Doppler Spectroscopy, commonly known as the Radial Velocity method. 
This techniue combines spectroscopy and the Doppler effect, hence the name. Spectrospcopy, in general, decomposes light coming from a source into 
bands that can determine what sort of elements a star is composed of. This is a little bit similar to using a prism to split a beam of white light
into a rainbow. Each chemical element has a known spectroscopic "signature" that is fundamentally characteristic of the element. When we look at 
the spectrum of stars with exoplanets, we notice an interesting effect: The spectrum seems to shift to one side, then shift back toward the other
direction, and repeat like that. The chemical composition of the star is essentially constant on this timescale, so something else must be causing
this shift.

This is where the Doppler effect comes in. The Doppler effect is most tangible with sirens on an ambulance or police car. When the car is approaching 
you, the pitch increases, and when it is moing away from you, the pitch decreases. Electromagnetic radiation behaves in a very similar way, and we also
describe this effect in terms of redshift and blueshift. When a light-emitting body moves toward an observer, the observed frequency is higher than
the proper emitted frequency, resulting in a shift "up" the EM spectrum, toward the blue side of visible light. 

When we combine this knowledge with spectroscopic data, we can determine the star's velocity variance. Finally, using Kepler's 3rd Law, we can determine
the planet's mass ratio to its host star. As an analogy, imagine if we heard an ambulance siren that was roughly maintaining its volume, but it was going
up and down periodically many times. We would then assume that the ambulance was continually going around a traffic circle. 
 

This technique has been used to successfully find many exoplanets, but it has some drawbacks
