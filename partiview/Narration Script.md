## Intro
Have you ever looked into a clear night sky and been amazed at the number of lights you can see? Even standing on earth, with its light pollution, 
one can still see many stars with the naked eye, including some of our neighbor planets. These planets are an exception, since they are so close to us. 
For planets outside our solar system, it is much harder to directly observe them, partly because they do not emit their own visible light. Nevertheless,
it is natural to wonder if there are stars in our galaxy, or even in other galaxies, that are host to a solar system like ours, with our 8 planets.

Before humans could put powerful telescopes in space, we had to work with relatively simple, ground-based telescopes. Even after the Hubble Telescope was
launched in 1990, we were not aware of other planetary systems. Any models we made about planetary formation were therefore only based
on our solar system. Our solar system has a number of characteristics that shaped our expectations for other planetary systems. For example, 
we have 4 terrestrial planets closest to the sun, and then 4 gas giant outside of that. All of the orbits are nearly circular, and also lie nearly in the same plane. 
For the past 25 years, scientists have investigated how representative our solar system is of all planetary systems, and whether our system's properties 
are also commonly found in other planetary systems. 
 
Reorder motivation with observation then conclusion

## Introduce Exoplanets
Up until 1995, the only planets we could see were the ones in our own solar system. However, in 1995, the first planet outside our solar system was discovered,
located 50 light-years away. It's called 51 Pegasi b, or simply 51 Peg. It is roughly 146 times earth's mass, has an orbital period of roughly 4 days, 
and has a nearly circular orbit. 51 Peg has size and mass comparable to Jupiter, yet is about 7 times closer to its sun than mercury is to our sun. (**Visual
comparison here in planet radius and orbital radius**) Because of this, planets with these characteristics are described as Hot Jupiters. 

## Detection problem
Since planet's don't normally produce their own visible light, detecting them is hard. However, the situation is much harder because planets appear extremely close
to their stars. The stars' light totally swamp out any reflected light from the planet. As an analogy, imagine if a street light represented a star, and a 
firefly represented a planet. When the firefly is very close to the light, it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish it from the streetlight itself, and
we might only see one apparent light source. When we look for exoplanets, which are many light years away, it is exceedingly rare to be able to directly
observe them, partly due to this effect. Therefore we must indirectly observe them. 

## Introduce Radial Velocity
The reason a planet is able to orbit a star is that the star exerts a gravitational attractive force on the planet, keeping it in a bound orbit.  
However, Newton's 3rd Law requires that the planet exerts the same force on the host star. Since the host star is commonly orders of magnitude greater
in mass than the planet, the star's motion will be barely affected by the planet. However, the heavier and closer the planet is, the stronger the effect.
This will cause the host star to also orbit the common center of mass of the system. We can use the star's motion to help predict the existance of an orbiting planet. 
For someone observing our solar system edge-on, Jupiter causes a 12.4 m/s oscillation in relative velocity, and Earth causes a 0.089 m/s oscillation. Even though
Jupiter is further away, it is much more massive than earth, which is why its effect is stronger.

In order to find a star moving in a circle like this, we use a technique called Doppler Spectroscopy, commonly known as the Radial Velocity method. 
This techniue combines spectroscopy and the Doppler effect, hence the name. Spectrospcopy, in general, splits light into colors that can determine 
what sort of chemical elements helped produce the light. This is a little bit similar to using a prism to split a beam of white light
into a rainbow. Each chemical element has a known spectroscopic "signature" that is fundamentally characteristic of the element. For example, 
some streetlights have a distinctive orange-yellowish glow. This is due to the sodium vapor inside the light.

Then we look at the spectrum of stars with exoplanets, we notice an interesting effect: The spectrum seems to shift to one side as time goes on, then it shifts
back toward the other direction, and repeats like that. The chemical composition of the star is essentially constant on this timescale, so something 
else must be causing this shift.

This is where the Doppler effect comes in. The Doppler effect is most tangible with sirens on an ambulance or police car. When the car is approaching 
you, the pitch increases, and when it is moing away from you, the pitch decreases. Electromagnetic radiation behaves in a very similar way, and we
describe this effect in terms of redshift and blueshift. When a light-emitting body moves toward an you, the observed frequency is higher than
the emitted frequency, resulting in a shift "up" the EM spectrum, toward the blue side of visible light. The shift in frequency is related to 
the relative velocity of the emitter and the observer.

When we combine this knowledge with spectroscopic data, we can determine the star's velocity change. Finally, using Kepler's 3rd Law, we can determine
the mass ratio of the planet to its host star, as well as the orbital period. As an analogy, imagine if we heard an ambulance siren that was roughly maintaining
its volume, but its pitch was going up and down periodically. We would then assume that the ambulance was continually going around a traffic circle. 
 
## RV Complications
This technique has been used to successfully find many exoplanets, but it has some drawbacks. If the orbit isn't "edge-on", then star's motion will be 
a little bit more side-to-side instead of to or from you. The problem is, we can't figure out using RV alone if there is this inclination, so the RV method
can's always give you an exact mass. In addition, not all orbits are circular, and the less circular it is, the harder it is to model the motion.
Finally, Hot Jupiters are the easiest type of exoplanets to detect, since they produce the largest effect. Therefore this method of detection
skews the distribution of discovered planets - the true percentage of Hot Jupiters out of all exoplanets is smaller than it would appear from just using RV.
Nevertheless, improvements in telescope design and data analysis have allowed astronomers to identifying planets with smaller mass and greater orbital radius
than before.



## Introduce Transit Method
In 1999, astronomers were able to confirm the existance of the exoplanet HD 209458b using a new detection technique, the transit method. This exoplanet
is 159 light-years from us, and is a Hot Jupiter. This characteristic makes it a candidate for radial velocity detection, and indeed it was originally
discovered this way. However, it is also detectable using the transit method technique.

Sometimes when we observe the light from a star, we notice that it dims periodically. This can indicate the presence of an orbiting exoplanet, since 
when the planet passes into our line of sight to the star, it will block some of the star's light from us, which will decrease the overall apparent
luminosity of the star. If this happens regularly, with a similar dip in luminosity each time, then this is evidence that something is orbiting
the star. The ratio of the planet's and star's radii determine how much light is blocked, and duration of the blockage can help find the orbital radius.
For an observer far from the sun, Jupiter, when it is directly in the line of sight, blocks roughly 1% of the sun's light, and Earth blocks 0.008% of the light.
By measuring the time between transits, we can find the orbital period, which we can relate to orbital distance through the stellar mass. In addition, with
information on the stellar radius, we can also find the planet's radius.


A very similar effect occurs during solar eclipses, when the moon is very close to being in between earth and the sun, and blocks some sunlight from 
reaching earth. However, this effect is slightly different because of the relative distances. Although the sun is roughly 400 times greater in radius than
then moon, the moon can totally eclipse the sun and block essentially all of its light. This is possible because the moon is also 390 times closer to us
than the sun is, making it appear that much larger. When detecting exoplanets however, the distance to the star or exoplanet is orders of magnitude greater
than the average orbital radius (light years versus light minutes). Therefore when we observe a transit on a distant star, we can only measure the overall 
brightness of star. We cannot see the part of the star that is blocked, unlike with our own sun-moon system. 

## Transit Complications
There are some complications with this technique. Multiplanet stars produce more complicated transit data and it is harder to resolve each planet individually.
Furthermore, the transit method completely relies on a rather unlikely event of the planet blocking a bit of the star light. There could be other reasons that 
the star appears dimmer, for example, a non-orbiting planet from another system happens to come into the line of sight, or a star stop is exposed. For this reason,
we need to confirm periodic dips in luminosity, and that takes time.
Therefore, this method is most effective at finding Hot Jupiters - planets which are large and block a larger percent of star light, and planets which are
closer to the star, have smaller orbit periods, produce periodic dips faster, and have a greater probability of crossing our line of sight. 
      
## Conclusion with focus on looking for life-sustaining planets
Radial velocity and transits are two complementary methods for finding exoplanets. There are also other methods that work better with planets that are not
Hot Jupiters. Astronomers use these techniques to find exoplanets and develop our understanding of our universe. In recent years, special attention has 
been given to researching planets that could support life. Of particular interest are terrestrial planets, planets which have similar size and mass to earth.
Furthermore, we would like to find planets which are not too close or too far from their host star, as this would make the planet too hot or too cold for life. 
Specifically, we are interested in the Habitable Zone, which is a region around any star where the planet temperature can support liquid water. 
Once we find a suitable planet, the next step would be to look for precursors to sustaining life, such as water traces and an atmosphere. 


In 2009, NASA launched the Kepler telescope, which trailed the Earth for 9 years, looking for exoplanets, particularily Earth-sized exoplanets. 
Kepler's primary method of detecting stars was using the transit method, and it found over 2,600 planets over its 9 years. 
In 2018, a follow-up mission was launched, called TESS, which will continue the search for exoplanets using the transit method. Kepler observed a fixed section of sky for its 9 years,
so it was able to look for more distant and dimmer stars. TESS will survey almost the entire sky, which is roughly 400 times more area than Kepler. Because 
of that, TESS will only be able to focus on the brightest stars, which will facilitate further study from ground-based telescopes.

Currently, we haven't found many Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, but Kepler has fond several candidates orbiting dwarf stars, such as Kepler-438b and Kepler-452b.
