Week 1:
Become comfortable with Partiview.
Begin preliminary research into GAIA 3 data and exoplanet discovery.
Work with sample data in Partiview to understand flight mechanics.
Starting python script to create flight path data usable by PartiView
Using cubic Bezier curves to smooth flight path.

Week 2:
Finished flight path modelling and figured out how camera angles work.
Looked for software that converts regular video to be compatible with half-dome projection.
Wrote script to have partiview save screenshots and stitch them together to form a video.
Produced "Demo" flight video to practice camera movement.
Figured out how to time evolving data and flight movement concurrently and record video of it.
Continued researching exoplanet detection to outline narration script.

Week 3:
Began filling out details on narration.
Received feeback on first draft, and revising to have more qualitative detail and simpler language.
Made a proof of concept sketch in partiview to show planet orbiting star.
